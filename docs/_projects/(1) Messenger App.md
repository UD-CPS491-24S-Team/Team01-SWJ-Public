# The Messenger Application

Capstone I focused on developing the familiarity with the software development lifecycle. In order to apply our learned skills, we spent the latter half of the semester building a messenger application from the ground up. This app aims to allow people to connect and message each other in a meaningful way.

We built a multi-page messenger application using the MESN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Socjet.io, NodeJS) web development framework.
