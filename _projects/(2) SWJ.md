# The Society of Women Journalists Website

The Society of Women Writers and Journalists is a British learned society for professional women writers founded in 1894. Dr. Laura Vorachek, and English Professor at the University of Dayton, desires a web application to organize and share the information that she has researched about the society from primary materials.

This is project has been ongoing for Capstone groups before us, and our goal is to redesign and complete the application.

As is described on the current SWJ website, the project's purpose include:
