# **About Us**

Hi! We're Team01 :wave:,<br>

Beecher Dunne, Sadie Kuprionis, Daniel Sheldon, and Angela Wise make up the amazing Team01 for Spring 2024's Capstone II.

Instructed by Nicholas Stiffler, we are applying the knowledge and skills we have culminated throughout our four years at the University of Dayton to contribute to a real-word software development project.

For our Capstone II project, we are working on the Society of Women Journalists website for Dr. Laura Vorachek, in coordination with and supervised by UD graduate students Julia Bays and Konor Tice.
